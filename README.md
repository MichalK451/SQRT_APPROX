This is a code from an academical project. The goal is to calculate the approximation of the decimal representation of the square root of 2. 
Project is divided in two parts. The first one called operations. It defines a new data structure, used to represent the next parts of the approximation.
Additionally it contains the implementation of all the necessary artithmetic operations for the new data structure.
The second one is called sqrt2 and its' main purpose is to use the functionality of operations to calculate the final result. It uses binary splitting algorithm
for the approximation.
